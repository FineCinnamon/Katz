# Λnk

_Compile time docs verification and evaluation for Kotlin and Java._

_Λnk_ short for [Ankhesenpaaten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankhesenamun) wife and sister of [Tutankhamun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamun), is a [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) plugin to verify code snippets in library docs for the Kotlin and Java programming languages.

Λnk is inspired by the awesome docs and tutorial generator for Scala [`tut`](http://tpolecat.github.io/tut/).

Λnk is a very simple documentation tool for Kotlin and Java written using [Λrrow](https://github.com/arrow-kt/arrow) that reads Markdown files and interprets and evaluates Kotlin and Java code in `ank` sheds, allowing you to write documentation that is typechecked and run as part of your build.
In a nutshell, Λnk works evaluating, then capturing results and including them after the expressions so they can be read in the documentation. The point of Λnk is to provide code that the user can type in and expect to work. 

## Basic setup

In your root `build.gradle`, add the Gradle Λnk dependency:

```groovy
buildscript {

    repositories {
        // ...
        maven { url "https://dl.bintray.com/arrow-kt/arrow-kt/" }
    }
    
    dependencies {
        // ...
        classpath 'io.arrow-kt:arrow-ank-gradle:<version>'
    }
}
```

Then apply it to each individual module where you want to use Λnk:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'ank-gradle-plugin'

dependencies {
    implementation 'io.arrow-kt:arrow-ank:<version>'
    // ...
}

ank {
    source = file("src/main/docs")
    target = file("build/site")
    classpath = sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath
}
```

## Run Λnk

```
./gradlew :module-name:runAnk
```

This will process all `*.md` files in `source`, write them to `target`, while providing all runtime dependencies (`sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath`) in the `classpath`.

## Errors output

When something goes wrong Λnk shows what snippet has failed and where, including the compiler errors.

## Modifiers

By default Λnk compiles and evaluates the snippets of code included in `ank` sheds. However sometimes you might want a definition without printing the result out, or might want to replace an entire snippet with the output of the resulting evaluation. For these occasions Λnk provides a number of modifiers that you can add to the shed declaration.
The language used (Kotlin or Java) should be prepended to `:ank` e.g. `kotlin:ank:replace`. The following modifiers are supported.

| Modifier | Explanation |
|---|---|
| `:silent` | Suppresses output; under this modifier the input and output text are identical. |
| `:replace` | Replaces an entire snippet with the output of the resulting evaluation. |
| `:outFile(<file>)` | Replaces the code fence entirely with an empty string and writes the result of the evaluated code into the specified file. |

## Patterns

Although Λnk supports both the _Tutorial_ mode (`import`s and variables previously declared are remembered) and the _Docs_ mode (all the necessary data is provided on each example without depending on declarations from previous snippets); the _Docs_ mode performs better. This is because the smaller the scope, the less memory and calculations need to be made, which means faster.
