/*
Arrow Fx : Bringing Typed FP to the masses.

Arrow Fx is direct syntax for Effects and Typed Functional Programming in Kotlin.

In the most recent years patterns like Tagless Final have become popular in the typed FP community in languages
like Haskell, Scala, Kotlin and even Java.

Arrow Fx takes tagless final and in general effectful programming over `IO` style monads further by:
- Providing compile-time guarantees that declared suspended effects don't compile/run in the environment uncontrolled,
- Eliminating all the syntactic noise of parametric `F` algebras by providing direct syntax in the environment with effect control over continuations.
- Auto-binding kinded results in FP Type class combinators eliminating the need to unwrap via do notation or monadic comprehensions.

In this talk we will look at some of the Kotlin and Arrow features and how Kotlin, despite some of its type system limitations
can bring FP to the masses by enabling direct style for effectful programming.
