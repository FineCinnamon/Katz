//Two options
//Disable and ignore MonadDefer laws and make DeferredK a Lazy version of Deferred but keep it memoized.
//Pros: this keeps it closer to the original `Deferred`, you could argue that this can be seen as a plus to make the step in lower.
//Cons: we make it unlawful by ignoring the MonadDefer laws, but we also ignore the stack-safety laws for RxJava.

//Keep it as is which in my opinion is also faulty because interaction with the original API makes it unlawful.
//Pros: ???
//Cons: With the current implementation we make it harder to reason about code, which makes it much less appealing as a poster child to come and use Arrow.
//Cons: We alter the lifecycle of `Deferred` which almost makes it a different data type. Since the API also behaves differently
// i.e. once a `Deferred` `isCompleted` it can never be `isActive == true` again. If you wrap it in `DeferredK` and call `start` it might
//given that nested within the `Deferred` is an `DeferredK` operation which runs again on `start` which is not the case when you're dealing with a regular `Deferred`.

//Third option??
//Write IO inter-op layer with Deferred??

//Fourth ??
