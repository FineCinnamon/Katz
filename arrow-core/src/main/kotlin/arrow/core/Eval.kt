/**
 * Eval is a monad which controls evaluation of a value or a computation that produces a value.
 *
 * Three basic evaluation strategies:
 *
 *  - Now:    evaluated immediately
 *  - Later:  evaluated once when value is needed
 *  - Always: evaluated every time value is needed
 *
 * The Later and Always are both lazy strategies while Now is eager.
 * Later and Always are distinguished from each other only by
 * memoization: once evaluated Later will save the value to be returned
 * immediately if it is needed again. Always will run its computation
 * every time.
 *
 * methods, which use an internal trampoline to avoid stack overflows.
 * Computation done within .map and .flatMap is always done lazily,
 * even when applied to a Now instance.
 *
 * It is not generally good style to pattern-match on Eval instances.
 * Rather, use .map and .flatMap to chain computation, and use .value
 * to get the result when needed. It is also not good style to create
 * Eval instances whose computation involves calling .value on another
 * Eval instance -- this can defeat the trampolining and lead to stack
 * overflows.
