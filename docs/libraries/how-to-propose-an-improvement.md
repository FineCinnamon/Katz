# Arrow library: How to propose an improvement

If it's the first time you contribute with a GitHub repository, take a look at [Collaborating with issues and pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests).

## How to create an issue

Please, follow the link to [create an issue](https://github.com/arrow-kt/arrow/issues/new/choose).

## How to create a pull request

Please, choose [`arrow-incubator`](https://github.com/arrow-kt/arrow-incubator) repository to add a new feature.

Does your improvement impact on **several repositories**? Please, use **the same branch name** in that case.

### Requirements to change an existing feature

If you want to propose a fix, rename, move, etc. please, ensure that these checks pass:

* Required checks:
    * `arrow library: build`
    * `arrow library: build documentation`
* The approval by 2 maintainers of the Arrow Community.

### Requirements to add a new feature

Please, ensure these points when adding a new feature:

* Use [`arrow-incubator`](https://github.com/arrow-kt/arrow-incubator) repository
* Include documentation via [Dokka](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/kotlin-doc.html). Please, find examples in the existing code to follow the same pattern.
* [Use Ank to validate for code snippets](https://github.com/arrow-kt/arrow-ank/blob/master/README.md)
* Include tests that cover the proper cases

When creating the pull request, ensure that these checks pass:

* Required automatic checks:
    * `arrow library: build`
    * `arrow library: build documentation`
* The approval by 2 maintainers of the Arrow Community.

### What happens when creating a pull request

When creating a pull request, several actions are executed automatically to check that pull request:

* Required checks
  * `arrow library: build`:
    * Install the Arrow library that's being improved in the local Maven repository.
    * Install other Arrow libraries that have related changes (there are open pull requests with the same branch name). The rest of the Arrow libraries will be downloaded from the [OSS repository](https://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local/io/arrow-kt/).
    * Run `check` Gradle task for the Arrow library that's being improved.
  * `arrow library: build documentation`:
    * Install the Arrow library that's being improved in the local Maven repository.
    * Install other Arrow libraries that have related changes (there are open pull requests with the same branch name). The rest of the Arrow libraries will be downloaded from the [OSS repository](https://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local/io/arrow-kt/).
    * Run `buildArrowDoc` Gradle task for the Arrow library that's being improved.

* Optional checks
  * `Check Previous Build Integration`:
    * Install all the Arrow libraries in the local Maven repository (open pull requests with the same branch name will be considered).
    * Run `check` Gradle task for all the Arrow libraries.
  * `Check Previous Doc Integration`:
    * Install all the Arrow libraries in the local Maven repository (open pull requests with the same branch name will be considered).
    * Run `buildArrowDoc` Gradle task for all the Arrow libraries.

Besides the required checks, it's necessary to get the approval by one of the members of the Arrow Community.

#### How to download the tests report

Both successful or failed build checks allow to download the tests report to review it:

### What happens when merging a pull request

When merging the pull request, a new SNAPSHOT library will be published into [OSS repository](https://oss.jfrog.org/artifactory/oss-snapshot-local/io/arrow-kt/).

On the other hand, the documentation for the next version (SNAPSHOT) will be updated:

* [Arrow Core](https://arrow-kt.io/docs/next/core/)
* [Arrow Fx](https://arrow-kt.io/docs/next/fx/)
* [Arrow Optics](https://arrow-kt.io/docs/next/optics/dsl/)
* [Arrow Incubator](https://arrow-kt.io/docs/next/aql/intro/)

And global checks will be executed again.

Please, if there are several related pull requests, merge them at the same time (one after the other). All these actions will wait for a few minutes to be started and to get the last content from `master` branch for all the repositories.

If any of these actions fails, an issue will be created to be solved as soon as possible.
